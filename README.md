# üìÑ Factura Automation
This project, Factura Automation, is written in Python and serves as a proof of concept for automating the digitization of handwritten invoices (spanish: factura) for Matchpoint Sports Canarias. It enables users to photograph, process, and store invoice data in Google Sheets. Note: This tool is solely intended as a demonstration and is not intended for production use or as a commissioned tool.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Overview
The project encompasses several components:

A mobile phone camera-style UI:
- Home Screen with a camera and a button to capture photos
- Settings Screen for customization
- Gallery Screen displaying all captured photos

A python backend:
- Camera
- Gallery including a watchdog
- Image Processor
- Settings Manager
- Google Sheets Manager

### Technical Workflow
1. UI: The responsive user interface is developed with Tkinter, mirroring the familiar layout of a camera app.
2. Image Capture: Using the OpenCV (cv2) and Pillow library, the app captures images, adds metadata (e.g., ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù), and stores the images.
3. Image Queue: Captured images are added to an image queue for background processing in a separate thread, allowing the UI to remain responsive. Unprocessed images are automatically reloaded into the image queue upon startup if the app is closed before completion.
4. Preprocessing:
	- The image is processed with SIFT and a FLANN-based matcher to detect and align the invoice based on a blank template.
	- A homography is calculated to warp the detected invoice corners, creating a straightened, 4:3 aspect image regardless of photo perspective.
5. Analysis with OpenAI:
The preprocessed image is analyzed using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 API (Vision) with a structured prompt and response schema for consistent output.
6. Data Storage: Extracted information is stored in Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API, formatted as required. Digitalization of the invoices is complete.
